hosting releases
================

Release repos can be hosted with any standard git hosting tools -- mdm release repos are still normal git repos.

Github works great as a git host.
Or perhaps your workplace wants an internal host, and they already have Stash from Atlassian; that works too.
Or if you're committed to pure open source, gitolite is a great option for self-hosting.

Even a jumpdrive works great as a host, since git is already oriented around distributed operation.  If you work in an industry or situation where airgaps or offline operation are critical, mdm will fit your usecase.

Any mirror and backup technology you have already in place for source code git repos also apply to release repos.
