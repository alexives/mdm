Anatomy of Release Repo History
===============================

First, a picture!

```

.               <-- branch="master"
.                       The master branch keeps going, and every time a new
.                       release is made, those files are merged in to master.

*               <-- commit=07  tag="mdm/master/v2.1"
|\                      moved artifact.jar -> v2.1/artifact.jar

|  *            <-- commit=06  branch="mdm/release/v2.1"
|                       added artifact.jar

*               <-- commit=05  tag="mdm/master/v2.0"

*               <-- commit=03  tag="mdm/master/v1.0"
|\                      moved artifact.jar -> v1.0/artifact.jar
| \                     moved artifact.so -> v1.0/artifact.so
|  |   
|  *            <-- commit=02  branch="mdm/release/v1.0"
|                       added artifact.jar
|                       added artifact.so
|    
|   
|  
| 
*               <-- commit=01  branch="mdm/init"
                        Nothing really to see here.  This is just the commit
                        created to inaugurate the releases repository.
```

As you can see above, there are two types of commits: a release commit, and a merge commit.

The release commits contain the files for one release version.
When `mdm update` fetches dependencies for a project, it pulls one of these commits.

The merge commits bring the files from one release commit into the master branch.
The actual artifact files from the release are moved to a subfolder, so it's easy to have every release ever checked out in one working tree.


### Master shows you the world

Checkout out the master branch gives you a folder per released version, each containing that version's files.

It's totally valid (and dang easy) to toss a `git checkout master` of an mdm release repo in an http server and call it your downloads page.
You noticed that's where you got mdm from right? ;)


### Fetching only what you need

The release branches don't accumulate each other's history,
so you can fetch them independently, without needing to pull down any data from the other branches.


### commit convergence

TODO can't decide if this deserves a whole page or just a section
