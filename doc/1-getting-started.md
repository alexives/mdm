getting started with mdm
========================

First, [install it](1.1-installing-mdm.md)!  :)  Or, if building from source is more your cup of tea, jump to [Section 4.1: building from source](4.1-building-from-source.md).

To get started in an existing project using mdm, your first steps are covered in [Section 2.1: Syncing Dependencies](2.1-syncing-dependencies.md).

To start a new project using mdm, or start contributing changes to dependencies in an existing project, you'll want to know about [Section 2.2: Adding, Changing, and Removing Dependencies](2.2-adding-changing-removing-dependencies.md).

If you're ready to start publishing releases using mdm, [Chapter 3: Using to Release](3-using-to-release.md) covers setting up releases for a new project, performing a release, and how to host and share releases.

If you prefer to learn about a system by studying the data structures and theory up front, [Chapter 4: Advanced Topics and Theorycraft](4-advanced-topics-and-theorycraft.md) is just for you.

Happy hacking :)
