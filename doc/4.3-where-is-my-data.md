Where is my data?
=================

Once you've fetched dependencies with mdm, the files are from the linked releases are dropped in your working tree.
They're also locally cached in git objects -- if you modify them, you can `git checkout` in the submodule to revert them, and all that good stuff.

If switching between two branches with different dependencies, after the first download, every subsequent `mdm update` on either branch is a fast, purely local zero-network operation.

If we assume your dependency is linked in a directory called `lib/{depName}/`:
  - the actual dependency files are in directories under `lib/{depName}/`.  (You knew that already.)
  - the git data dir (the one that contains the compressed delta'd objects, refs, etc) is under `.git/modules/lib/{depName}/`.
    (Notice how this is *inside* of your project repo's `.git/` dir instead of in the working tree.  This means that even when you nuke-n-pave your working tree, the compressed delta'd forms of dependencies you'd previously fetched are still here on your local disk.)
  - the url to the remote git host of the dependency repo is stored in `.git/config`.
    (This is a feature of git that allows local overrides to be made to repo urls.  It is pretty redundant by default, but it's perfect if you want an advanced situation like a full cache of http://mdm-releases.com/ on a host in your LAN or even local filesystem, for example.)
