installing mdm
==============


Installing from a release
-------------------------

### get mdm

You can get the latest version of mdm here:

http://mdm-releases.net/net.polydawn/mdm-releases/v2.17.3/mdm

Or, alternatively, mirrored here:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdm-releases/mdm-releases/master/v2.17.3/mdm

### put it on your path

If you're a linux or mac user, this is probably familar: `mdm` needs to end up on your `$PATH` somehow, and it needs to end up marked as executable.

If you've never done that before, don't worry.  Here's an easy way to get working:

```bash
wget http://mdm-releases.net/net.polydawn/mdm-releases/v2.17.3/mdm
chmod +x mdm
sudo cp -i mdm /usr/bin/
```

Building from source
--------------------

If you prefer to build from source, jump ahead to [Section 3.1 -- building from source](3.1-building-from-source.md).





FIXME decide where put this:
If you're coming to an existing project, it's possible that mdm is also just bound into the fabric of the project's build.
mdm itself is an example of this -- when you run the standard build script, it will )
