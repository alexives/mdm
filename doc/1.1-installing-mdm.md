installing mdm
==============


Installing from a release
-------------------------

### get mdm

You can get the latest version of mdm here:

http://mdm-releases.net/net.polydawn/mdm-releases/v2.19.1/mdm

Or, alternatively, mirrored here:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdm-releases/mdm-releases/master/v2.19.1/mdm


### get java

mdm relies on a java runtime environment for cross-platform [portability](5.1-portability.md).
You likely already have java available, but if not, installers are available for your platform.

Latest official java releases are available from Oracle here: https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

Alternatively, you may be interested in (unofficial) openJDK builds: https://github.com/alexkasko/openjdk-unofficial-builds

Any version of java between 1.6 (released 2007) to 1.8 (to the latest nightlies) is supported.


### put mdm on your path

If you're a linux or mac user, this is probably familar: `mdm` needs to end up on your `$PATH` somehow, and it needs to end up marked as executable.

If you've never done that before, don't worry.  Here's an easy way to get working:

```bash
wget http://mdm-releases.net/net.polydawn/mdm-releases/v2.19.1/mdm
chmod +x mdm
sudo cp -i mdm /usr/bin/
```

The story for windows is slightly different.
The download link is the same.
You may need to rename `mdm` -> `mdm.jar`.
You may also find it convenient to create a bat file to shortcut `java -jar mdm.jar` for you.



Building from source
--------------------

If you prefer to build from source, jump ahead to [Section 4.1 -- building from source](4.1-building-from-source.md).





FIXME decide where put this:
If you're coming to an existing project, it's possible that mdm is also just bound into the fabric of the project's build.
mdm itself is an example of this -- when you run the standard build script, it will )
