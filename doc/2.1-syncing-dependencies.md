syncing dependencies
====================

When coming to a project that uses mdm to manage dependencies, use `mdm update`.

`mdm update` is a one-stop-shop command that:

- downloads dependencies, if you haven't got them already
- puts the right versions in the current working tree
- cleans up any dependencies that are not required on your current branch

In other words, it puts things where they're supposed to be.


### syncing dependencies after a fresh clone

Run `mdm update` ;)

### syncing dependencies after switching branches

Run `mdm update` ;)

### syncing dependencies after pulling changes

Run `mdm update` ;)

### syncing dependencies after checking out an old commit

Run `mdm update` ;)

### so I should run mdm-update every time I build?

Ah, you're seeing the pattern!  :)

In short: yeah, that's a pretty safe policy.
And there's very little cost to doing so!  `mdm update` typically takes a fraction of a second to run (assuming it already has all downloads out of the way; if it does have to fetch new versions of any dependencies, of course this will depend on your bandwidth).

Either `git status` or `mdm status` can tell you if you're out of sync and need to do an `mdm update`, but quite frankly, it's just as fast to just go ahead and do the `mdm update` anyway.
