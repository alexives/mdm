syncing dependencies
====================

When coming to a project that uses mdm to manage dependencies, use `mdm update`.

`mdm update` is a one-stop-shop command that:

- downloads dependencies, if you haven't got them already
- puts the right versions in the current working tree
- cleans up any dependencies that are not required on your current branch

In other words, it puts things where they're supposed to be.
