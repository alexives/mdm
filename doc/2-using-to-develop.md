Using mdm to develop
====================

If you're jumping in to an existing project, the first thing you'll want to do is run this:

```bash
mdm update
```

That's it: the 'update' command is generally a one-stop-shop that tries to put your current workspace in shape.  You can read more about the update command in [Section 2.1: Syncing Dependencies](2.1-syncing-dependencies.md).

After a successful `mdm update`, the project should be ready to run/build/whatever!

(This manual can't tell you what to expect for a build process after that: every project is different, and mdm doesn't get involved in a project after the dependency management part is done.)
