ssh checklist
=============

mdm supports use of ssh transport via the [jsch library](http://jcraft.com/jsch/).
You do not need any system installation of an `ssh` command in order to use mdm with an ssh transport.

#### Are encrypted ssh keys supported?
  - Yes!  You'll recieve an interactive prompt for the password.

#### Are password logins supported?
  - Yes!  You'll recieve an interactive prompt for the password.  (But you should really consider using keys.)

#### Something went wrong!
  - Check if you can ssh using your system ssh prompt.  If that doesn't work, jsch probably won't either -- it attempts to read the same configs.

  - If you're using keys and have a complicated `~/.ssh/config`, consider putting a very explicit rule for what key to use for the servers mdm contacts.  Jsch attempts to parse all of the intricasies of openssh config files, but it can't be guaranteed to catch everything.
    Here's an example of a simple explicit `~/.ssh/config` looks for me:
    ```
    Host github.com
        IdentityFile  ~/.ssh/github_rsa
    ```

#### Supported keys
  - jsch only supports RSA and DSA keys.  Unfortunately, ECDSA is not supported at this time.
    (There's good odds this won't affect you.  Other popular git hosting services like Atlassian stash also only gained ECDSA support within the year.)
