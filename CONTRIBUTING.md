    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part

    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

## Pull request procedure

To make a pull request, you will need a GitHub account; if you are unclear on this process, see GitHub's documentation on [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Pull requests should be targeted at the `master` branch. Before creating a pull request, go through this checklist:

1. Create a feature branch off of `master` so that changes do not get mixed up.
1. [Rebase](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) your local changes against the `master` branch as you develop; this keeps history clean.
1. Run the full project test suite with the `ant run-test` and `ant run-mdma` commands and confirm that it passes.
1. Accept the Developer's Certificate of Origin on all commits (see above).

Pull requests will be treated as "review requests," and maintainers will give feedback on the style and substance of the patch.

Normally, all pull requests must include tests that test your change.  Occasionally, this may be difficult because of surrounding systems.  In these cases, feel free to reach out to a maintainer for assistance.  We want to strive to raise the quality of the product with every PR.
